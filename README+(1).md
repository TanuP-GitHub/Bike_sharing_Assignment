# Bike_Sharing_Assignment
> This assignment is a programming assignment wherein we have to build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes.

## General Information
-BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands
-Specifically, this project want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.
- Dataset is day.csv which consist of all info related to bike rides

## Technologies Used
-python - version 3.0

## Conclusions
- Our Train-Test dataset have almost similar values of r2 and adj r2, hence our predictions are correct and we can consider this model as final model.

- Also, demand for bike rides depends on - atemp, september month, holiday, year, windspeed, light_snowrain, winter, spring, misty
- Model lr_4 seems to be linear and best fitted to the error
  no multicollinearity is present, homoscedasticity is seen
